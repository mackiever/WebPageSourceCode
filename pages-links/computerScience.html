					    <p>Since I enjoyed math very much I decided that programming would be easier to learn and result in a great opportunity for me to 
					    	learn Java and other web development languages such as JavaScript and PHP.  There are so many languages to learn from and one must
					    	always be up to date with technology because there is never an end to this career filled with many opportunities. </p>

					    <p>In my senior year in college, I was able to take a class which involved designing a web page without knowing HTML5, CSS or JavaScript.  
					    	Final project was to be completed in one semester and despite the awful detail to design, the project was able to put together 3 
					    	individuals who never had the chance to work on a Web Development project before.  This is where I decided to spend more
					    	time learning JavaScript and PHP.</p>

						<h1>Why Computer Science Degree?</h1
						><article>
							<p>At a very young age my father bought me my very first computer where I was able to explore the amazing place the internet was becoming and soon
							change the way I saw the world.  I still remember connecting to the internet through a dial-up connection and everything running 
							very slow.  I was involved with a very particular strategy game called StarCraft where I really began wondering how such a game could
							be developed with the help of a programming language.  From then on I had already grown an interest in software with a little
							help from the math classes which I enjoyed very much.  Before applying to colleges I already knew that a Computer Science degree 
							would be the best choice for me.  I can see now that the world is changing very fast and with the help of software design many
							more things are to come in the near future.</p
